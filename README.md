# ImageJ-TomographyTools
This repo contains ImageJ/FIJI macros for processing x-ray tomography datasets generated the at Advanced Light Source.

## Overview:
[Beamline 8.3.2][BL832] is located at the Advanced Light Source [(ALS)][ALS] located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [(LBNL)][LBNL]. 8.3.2 is a synchrotron x-ray endstation that is devoted to x-ray microtomography. Tomography analysis requires processing of large (many GB) datasets that contain 32-bit image stacks. Manually performing operations on these data sets can be time consuming. This repository is an attempt to consolidate a toolkit of useful FIJI macros to process stacks of image data produced by the x-ray tomography performed at 8.3.2.

## About ImageJ/FIJI:
ImageJ is and open source java based image processesing toolkit commonly used for microscopy and imaging applications. FIJI is the prefered distribution of ImageJ that includes many plugins useful for scientific image analysis. FIJI is also the unfortunate acronym for 'FIJI is Just ImageJ'. Please see the [ImageJ website][FIJI] for more details and downloads.
